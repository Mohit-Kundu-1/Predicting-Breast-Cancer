# Predicting-Breast-Cancer

Logistic Regression Model has been used to predict the chances of Breast Cancer 

**About Dataset**

Attribute Information:-
id

diagnosis: M = malignant, B = benign

Columns 3 to 32

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

radius: distances from center to points on the perimeter

texture: standard deviation of gray-scale values

perimeter

area

smoothness: local variation in radius lengths

compactness: perimeter^2 / area - 1.0

concavity: severity of concave portions of the contour

concave points: number of concave portions of the contour

symmetry

fractal dimension: "coastline approximation" - 1 The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.
